          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Since 2008 I have been working on Business Management, helping people
            and companies with Strategic Planning, Analysis of Scenarios, Decision
            Making, Diagnosis of Organizational, Management and Leadership Skills,
            Development and Application of Processes, Development and Management
            of Teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2011, I started a retail franchise Business, where I coordinate
            financial and administrative areas.
          </p>

          <p>
            The programming world started as a curiosity and turned out to be a
            vast and deep universe where I see myself in. Therefore, I began my
            journey on learning the path to become a Frontend Developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background as a Consultant and in Management has shown me that a
            solid Strategic Plan inspires a stronger sense of belonging for people
            at organizations, and this is also valid for customers' experience,
            directly reflecting on the performance of the company and the product.
            And that is why I am very interested about users interactions and how
            it affects their experience of products and services.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently an Associate Consultant at Miguelina Borges Consultoria
            Empresarial, an Administrative and Financial Manager for Kidstok
            Buriti and Cerrado, and a Frontend Developer apprentice.
          </p>

          <p>Married to Thais. Líam´s and Dan's dad.</p>
